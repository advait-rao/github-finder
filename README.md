# Github-Finder

> This project allows you to search for Github users and access some basic user information.
> It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

I decided to build this application to learn and practice my front-end development skills, using **React.js**.

## How it works

I used **React.js** to build this project. I did not use any CSS frameworks.
The application displays components that have information obtained by making requests to the Github API.

## Usage

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

## Hosting

I am currently hosting this application on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/]).
